Searches for any processes bound to ports and formats everything in a nice table.
You can get better information on processes that may have been started with specific arguments you'd be more familiar with.
ie. you start 'node app.js' in a specific directory and you want to search for that

ie. you start a node process using pm2 and you want to search for that.

ie. you start a node package like node-inspector and want to search for that.
